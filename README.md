# ntm's Cave Story

A remake of Studio Pixel's Cave Story in C++ and SDL2 library, based on a guide by Limeoats.

My project for INT2215 6 class - Advanced Programming, lectured by [@chauttm](https://github.com/chauttm "chauttm's GitHub").

## Build

I use _VSCode_, compiled with _mingw-w64-gcc-8.1.0-x86_64-posix-seh_. Library used are:

- SDL2-2.0.5-x86_64-w64-mingw32
- SDL2_image-2.0.5-x86_64-w64-mingw32
